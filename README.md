# 🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs Image Classification (SVC Model)

This project implements an **image classification system** that distinguishes between images of **cats** and **dogs** using a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**.  
It’s a simple yet powerful example of applying **machine learning** to computer vision tasks.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Automatically classify whether a given image is of a cat or a dog.
- **Approach:** 
  - Convert images into grayscale and resize for uniformity.
  - Flatten image data into feature vectors.
  - Train an **SVC model** with optimized kernel parameters.
- **Dataset:** [Kaggle - Dogs vs Cats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) *(or any other dataset you used)*

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:**
  - `numpy` & `pandas` → Data handling
  - `opencv-python` → Image preprocessing
  - `scikit-learn` → Model building and evaluation
  - `matplotlib` → Data visualization

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cats-vs-dogs-svc.git
   cd cats-vs-dogs-svc
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare dataset**

   * Download the dataset and place it inside the `dataset/` folder.
   * Ensure images are named/labeled properly (e.g., `cat.1.jpg`, `dog.1.jpg`).

## 🚀 Usage

### **Train the model**

```bash
python src/train.py
```

### **Make predictions**

```bash
python src/predict.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
```

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric    | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| F1-score  | 63%   |
| Precision | 65%   |
| Recall    | 61%   |

*Results may vary depending on dataset split and hyperparameters.*

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add a **deep learning model** (e.g., CNN) for improved accuracy.
* Implement a **web interface** for easy image uploads.
* Experiment with **data augmentation** to improve generalization.

If you want, I can also make a **visually appealing version** of this README with badges, a preview image, and GitHub-style tables so it looks more professional on your profile. That will make your project stand out.
